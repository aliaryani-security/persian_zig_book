# Persian Zig Book
 Hello there gorgeous !<br>

 This book is the Persian translation of [Zig Book](https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book), Which is the most amazing book I've seen on Zig Language.<br>

- You can access the book [here](https://aliaryani-security.github.io/persian-zig-book/),<br>
- You can also clone this repo and run the book using `mdbook`

I'm doing this for free , and I'll be thankful if you follow me on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/aliaryani.security), and my [X](https://x.com/aliaryani_sec).<br>
